* R reference card

Welcome to R reference card. It contains the reference documentation that
describes how to perform *data analysis* using R.

* Getting started and getting help

- args(function) ::
     Look at the arguments of a FUNCTION.

* Some basics

- =<-= ::
     Assign a value to a variable.

- =ls()= ::
     Show objects in my workspace.

** Defining a function

#+begin_src R
myfunction <- function(x) {
    y <- norm(100)
    mean(y)
}
#+end_src

* Navigating the software

- =getwd()= ::
     Figure out what your working directory is.

- =library(package)= ::
     Load PACKAGE.

- =data(dataset)= ::
     Load DATASET.

- =source("file.R")= ::
     Load R code file.

* Input and output

- =read.table("file.txt")= ::
     Read tabular data file, create data frame.

     Important arguments:
     + =file=,
     + =header=,
     + =sep= (defaults to the *space*)
     + =colClasses=, class of each column
     + =nrows=,
     + =comment.char=,
     + =skip=, number of lines to skip from the beginning
     + =stringsAsFactors= (defaults to =TRUE=)

- =read.csv("file.csv")= ::
     Read data from CSV file, create data frame.
     + =header= defaults to =TRUE=
     + default =separator=: *comma*

* Data structures

| Class     | Example                     |
|-----------+-----------------------------|
| =logical=   | =TRUE= / =FALSE=                |
| =integer=   | =1L= (with explicit =L= suffix) |
| =numeric=   | =0.5= or =1= (/real/ numbers)     |
| =complex=   | =1+0i=                        |
| =character= | "hello" (lowest class)      |

** Vectors

*Vectors* are sets of elements of the /same class/.

When objects of different classes are mixed in a vector, /coercion/ occurs behind
the scene so that every element is of the same class (the "lowest common
denominator" class).

** Matrices

*Matrices* are vectors with multiple dimensions (=dimension= attribute).

** Lists

*Lists* are vectors of objects of possibly different classes.

** Factors

*Factors* are /qualitative/ variables used to represent /categorical/ data, to store
self-describing codes for /labels/ (such as "male" and "female", or "low",
"medium" and "high").

Unordered or ordered.

** Data frames

*Data frames* are used to store tabular data where each column can be of a
different class.

- Row = observation, column = variable
- Special type of list (of variables in columns) where every element has
  the same length
- Special attribute =row.names= (every row has a name, or defaults to a
  sequence of integers)
- Most often created by calling =read.table()= or =read.csv()=

** Functions

- =as.*()= ::
     Explicitly coerce from one class to another.

- =as.numeric()= ::
     Coerce the (=character=) column to be =numeric=.

- =as.Date("January 2, 2007", "%B %d, %Y")= ::
     "2007-01-02"

- =as.ts()= ::
     Convert to a time series object.

* Data transformations

* Strings and dates

* Probability

* General statistics

* Graphics

* Linear regression and ANOVA

* Useful tricks

** Peeking at your data

- =head()= ::
     Look at the first 6 rows.

- =tail()= ::
     Look at the last 6 rows.
